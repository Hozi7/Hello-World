# Hello-World
A repository with ideas and documents 
My name is Honor and i'm trying to learn how to code. I love languages and exploring the world but Honor the explorer is somewhat less catchy than Dora. 
I want to be a role model to others but it's easier said than done. 
I like to be challenged and try my best. 
I like video games even if I am not very good at them.
